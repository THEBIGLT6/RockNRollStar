# Rock 'N' Roll Star
Liam Truss\
CompSci 4482 App 3/ 4

## Overview
Rock 'N' Roll Star is intended to be a 3D beat 'em up style game where the user takes on as the main hero looking to secure all of the stolen records back from the suits. The goal of the player is to collect all 5 of the missing records while generating as much score as possible. Score is awarded for 1. Time of completion, 2. Damage dealt, 3. Records collected and 4. Health remaining. The game ends when the "Rock 'N' Roll Star" by Oasis record is collected. This is my submission for app3 and app4, to change languages simply go into the settings menu in the pause menu or main menu and change the language to french. 

## Controls
WASD - player movement \
Left shift (while moving) - Sprint \
Mouse - camera movement \
Left click - Punch (Rightly timed double click does a 2nd punch dealing more damage) \
Right click - Kick (more damage than punch) \
1 - Drum Solo (kills all nearby enemies) \
Esc. - pause

## Mechanics

Listed below are some of my requierments / mechanics I looked to implement:

- Enemys navigate using an AI nav mesh and will chase the user when its close enough and look to attack when close as well
- Unique enemy attacks that change (punch vs push)
- A combo system for the user if attacks are timed well
- An enemy that can shoot and its somewhat realistic
- A special user attack that takes out all enemies in the area (and has the rings on the floor)
- A scoring mechanic that rewards different performance based goals
- Main menu fades in with Welcome to the Jungle
- Cleanly fading music system
- Consistent settings that load in on start and save on exit (along with the localization tool)
